Hey, I'm Bozhie, a California native who's always been captivated by the wonders of nature. Growing up in North Lake Tahoe, I spent my days skiing, hiking, and soaking in the beauty of the outdoors.

I graduated from UC Berkeley in 2019, with a Bachelor of Science in Bioengineering. My studies revolved around synthetic biology, alternative materials, and the captivating realm of bioinformatics. I've always been fascinated by the fusion of technology and biology and its potential to revolutionize our understanding of the natural world.

My career took off at Tierra Biosciences, where I spent three years involved in research and development. Here, I made use of my lab-coat and saw the development of biological discovery to launching a product. I played a pivotal role in R&D, developing tools, automating processes, and contributing to computational research tools.

Currently, I'm pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science at the University of Southern California, focusing on data science and machine learning. I'm excited to harness the power of data to drive change in the world of biology. When I'm not diving into data, you'll find me surfing, running, hiking, or otherwise exploring the vibrant city of Los Angeles, my current home.
